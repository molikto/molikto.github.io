## what is my goal?

**2015/12/27**
: forget your existance.

**added in 2015/12/17**
: How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.

**added in 2015/11/22**
: I've read an article called "We are stardust". so maybe we are just the universe looking at itself

**added in 2015/11/17**
: 无论我们爱过多少错的 爱过多少对的 都可能是为了某个人 遇到某个人 也都不重要了 最重要的是这个对的人一旦出现的时候 你已经答应自己 以后都不要再有前任 起码这个人不可以成为前任

**added in 2015/11/15**
: i really like the [personality of Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s#Personality). also I like the personality of Snailya, whom i will remember for my whole life and I used her name as the title of this site.
i think the goal should be changed. it should be "discover beauty". beauty takes various forms, it can be mathematics, physics, music, game, love, daily life, everything. and sometimes you need to have some second order goals in certain conditions, like making money if you are poor (like I am now). but still this is a personal view, is this personal? I means in contrast what is global? the humanity? all creature in earth? or all universe? it is not clear how this is defined. and i think personal is in some sense global. so maybe I shouldn't bother myself by this question anymore. 


**original**
: experience and understand the world in the finite amount of time i have. quoting Yann Tiersen "I am gonna live anyhow". also *Adventure Time* S06E43 *The Comet*.

## trivialities

I use some tools to make my life organized. i use OmniFocus to **plan** and as **inbox**, Google Calendar to **record** process and **index** result, blogging and Zetero to **store**. how do i know if something goes to store or inbox? simple, stuff has content goes to store, stuff does not (like a reading list) goes to inbox, after the actual content is retrieved, goes to store

* stackedit.io and export as blog
	* big trunk of notes in relatively good formating
	* meta-notes about all the stuff listed
* Google Calendar and Calendar on Mac OS X
    * used to record time usages it provide pointers into other sections
    * also used to record non-technical stuff such as diary
* OmniFocus
    * keeps big project of todos
    * small inboxes per project base
    * todo for non-technical
    * use the forecast view to determine what to do
* Zetero --- stuff inside is stuff that at least you know about what it is
    * books --- sometimes with inline notes
    * papers --- sometimes with inline notes
    * notes
* outside world
	* the GTM collection in my disk and other book collections
	* the Internet

## music

I claim that Yann Tiersen is god. it is the Grothendieck in music. I also like

* Philip Glass
* my little airport
* 窦唯
* Bach
