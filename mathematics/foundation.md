## foundation

* we work in ZFC + Universes, which is a **first order logic** with **equality** with **axioms** bellow `TODO: they are still not clear enough`
	* **extensionality**. $\forall a, b (\forall z, z \in a \to z \in b) \to a =b$
	* **pairing**. there is a set $\{a, b\}$
	* **schema of separation**
	* **union**
	* **power set**
	* **infinity**
	* **schema of replacement**
	* **regularity**
	* **choice**
	* **universe**
* basic definitions
	* **function**
		* function is associ. (f(gh))= (fg)h <= (f (gh))x = ((fg)h)x <= f ((gh)x) = (fg) (hx) <= f(g(hx)) = (fg)(hx) <= f(g(hx)) = f(g(hx)). *if you are thinking in pl term, it is obvious, like `app`, `comp` etc.*
