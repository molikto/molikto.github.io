<ul>
<li>Most structural editor only allow syntax-correct programs, like <a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a>, <a href="https://www.lamdu.org/">Lamdu</a> or <a href="https://fructure-editor.tumblr.com/">Fructure</a>. Sometimes they project to a lines-of-token presentation (Hazel), sometimes not (Lamdu)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/">MPS</a>  is an editor that constantly performs syntax-directed and type-directed editing on the AST, but mimics text-editors. It allows some level of incorrect syntax. But in general the AST is not parsed, you cannot perform some complex editing, for example, wrapping some code by  <code>{}</code> and hope it just works like in a text editor. Most of time the projection is lines-of-token, but they support two dimensional math expressions, and tables.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/softdevteam/eco">Eco</a> is an editor that works like a text editor when you are editing in a single language, but you can compose different languages and these language boxes works in a structural editor way</li>
<li>text editors</li>
</ul>
<p>I think editors more strict (including) than MPS has their problems (which I will not elaborate here).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider what&rsquo;s between MPS and Eco, remembering Eco&rsquo;s idea is based on incremental lexing &amp; parsing:</p>
<ul>
<li>An editor where token is edited structurally like MPS but syntax is incrementally parsed like Eco. So the data format in this editor is not a syntax tree (like in MPS), or string (like in text editors, and to some extends, Eco), but is a sequence of tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>This has the advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because whitespace is insignificant after lexing, we can do automate layout: you cannot do this in Eco because tokens is incrementally lexed, so you must preserve the whitespace and new lines exactly as whitespace will affect lexing result</li>
<li>Escape characters is not needed, so you can have a keyword <code>define</code> and a variable <code>define</code> and they will be displayed in different color</li>
<li>Edits will not change token&rsquo;s type, which is most of time undesired. We can have a &ldquo;paste as plain text&rdquo; like rich text editors to escape from this restriction</li>
<li>Color and font matters: for example in a <a href="https://github.com/agda/cubical">cubical type theory</a> <code>1</code> can means number literal or a constant formula, but in Cubical Agda you need to write <code>i1</code> for the second case. In the proposed editor, they can have different font, and which one is selected is edited in a type-directed way</li>
</ul>
<p>Also this allows a much more text-editor like UX: actually it is just a rich text editor.</p>
