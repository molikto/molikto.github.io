* #question# How to integrate dependent type with mutability?
  * Motivation: I am amazed by how lean4 write it's elaborator in Lean itself. The elaborator code uses monadic code all the time. https://github.com/leanprover/lean4. So I wonder if one can create a dependent typed language with good old mutable states?
  * Mutable reference is easy: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255077/how-does-a-dependently-typed-programming-language-cope-with-mutability
  * Mutable cells? It seems we can just create a new sort `prop < set < mem`
* #question# Then how does other languages handle recursive functions in semantic domain?
  * I guess https://github.com/kino3/Mini-TT/blob/master/Main.hs#L120. The evaluation envirment doesn't contain semantical values of the recursive definition, but syntax of the recursive definition, with cycle breaked by indirection.
