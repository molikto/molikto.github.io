* Q: How to integrate dependent type with mutability?
  * motivation: I am amazed by how [lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) write it's elaborator in Lean itself: the elaborator code uses monadic code all the time. So I wonder if one can create a dependent typed language with good old mutable states?
  * mutable reference is easy: [link](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255077/how-does-a-dependently-typed-programming-language-cope-with-mutability)
  * mutable cells? It seems we can just create a new sort `prop < set < mem`
    * mutable state is done by having fields in a telescope mutable, `def list(T: mem): men = record { mut head: T, tail: list(T) }`
    *  a records/enum with mutable state will not allow dependency on `mut field`
    * do we need sort polymorphic definitions? like `def point(T: α): α = record { first: T, second: T}`
      * much like [universe lifting](https://pigworker.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/universe-hierarchies/), no actual variable is introduced, but we just duplicate the definition at all sorts, and type check all of them
      * does these non-first-class features enough? It reminds me of [non first class blocks in Effekt language](https://effekt-lang.org/design-considerations.html)
* Q: Then how does other languages handle recursive functions in semantic domain?
  * in MiniTT [this line](https://github.com/kino3/Mini-TT/blob/master/Main.hs#L120) is the key. The evaluation envirment doesn't contain semantical values of the recursive definition, but syntax of the recursive definition, with cycle breaked by indirection.
