* `question`: how to integrate dependent type with mutability?
  * motivation: I am amazed by how lean4 write it's elaborator in Lean itself. The elaborator code uses monadic code all the time. https://github.com/leanprover/lean4. So I wonder if one can create a dependent typed language with good old mutable states?
  * mutable reference is easy: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/255077/how-does-a-dependently-typed-programming-language-cope-with-mutability
  * mutable cells? It seems we can just create a new sort `prop < set < state`
