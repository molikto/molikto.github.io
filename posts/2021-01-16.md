* Q: How to implement typeclasses in proof assistants (Coq, Lean).
  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WhFpnfD-Tw) of the basics
    * Haskell
      * apartness
      * coherence: all instances are the same
      * it is used to ensure code correctness (sorted map with insert and union)
        * How Scala handles it if you union two sorted map with different order instances: it doesn't care if the second parameter is sorted or not, [link](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/SortedMap.html#++[V2%3E:V](xs:scala.collection.IterableOnce[(K,V2)]):CC[K,V2])
        * in video: it should use dependent type, the SortedMap depends on the order
    * Scala
      * [this issue](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-feature-requests/issues/4)
  * (Tabled Type class Resolution)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04301]
* Q: How is extension methods implemented
  * Are they just baby typeclasses? No, because they can have different types. It is called ad-hoc overloading in [Elaboration in Dependent Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04324) and [this](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/d3d245c711bba039ddf2f7e35ce483505aa2970e/tests/elabissues/overload_with_list_coercion.lean#L1)

* Q: Again, how the elaborator as a whole works: integrate meta solving, type class resolution, ad-hoc overloading and coercions?
  * The Lean 2 paper seems not apply very well to Lean 4 implementation
* Overview of Lean 4 source code
  * [slides from 2019](http://leanprover.github.io/talks/vu2019.pdf)
    * outdated, compiler is in Lean
  * [slides from 2020](http://leanprover.github.io/talks/LeanACL2.pdf)
    * the object header is 1 word, it use 64bits to encode a lot of information
  * [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) repo `/src`
  * `Lean` is the elaborator & compiler of Lean implemented in Lean
    * `Compiler` backend
    * `Elab` is the elaborator
      * `PreDefinition` is termination checking, or translation to eliminators
    * `Meta` is meta solving and all that
    * `Parser` is the extensible parsers and all that
* Lean4 changed its naming convention from `snake_case` to `camelCase`??!!
