* Q: How to implement typeclasss in proof assistants (Coq, Lean).
  * [a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WhFpnfD-Tw) of the basics
    * Haskell
      * apartness
      * coherence: all instances are the same
      * it is used to ensure code correctness (sorted map with insert and union)
        * How Scala handles it if you union two sorted map with different order instances: it doesn't care if the second parameter is sorted or not, [link](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/SortedMap.html#++[V2%3E:V](xs:scala.collection.IterableOnce[(K,V2)]):CC[K,V2])
* Q: How is extension methods implemented; are they just baby typeclasses?
