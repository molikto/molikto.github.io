* Q: How to implement typeclasss in proof assistants (Coq, Lean).
  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WhFpnfD-Tw) of the basics
    * Haskell
      * apartness
      * coherence: all instances are the same
      * it is used to ensure code correctness (sorted map with insert and union)
        * How Scala handles it if you union two sorted map with different order instances: it doesn't care if the second parameter is sorted or not, [link](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/SortedMap.html#++[V2%3E:V](xs:scala.collection.IterableOnce[(K,V2)]):CC[K,V2])
        * in video: it should use dependent type, the SortedMap depends on the order
    * Scala
      * [this issue](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-feature-requests/issues/4)
  * (Tabled Type class Resolution)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04301]
* Q: How is extension methods implemented; are they just baby typeclasses?
  * Lean seems to have it, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04324) and [this](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/d3d245c711bba039ddf2f7e35ce483505aa2970e/tests/elabissues/overload_with_list_coercion.lean#L1)
