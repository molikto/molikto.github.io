* [Memory layout and staging part 1: type-passing polymorphism, two-level type theory introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmNqXP9Hp_A&t=1725s)
  * only watched the first part
* ordered packages for programming languages
  * take a look at [Lean mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src), I wish these packages are ordered like a math book chapters, by dependency relations
  * it is misfit for using folders and files to represent packages
  * the files of a project should be acyclic, [lihaoyi/acyclic for Scala](https://github.com/lihaoyi/acyclic), we should be able to linearly order all files in a project automately
  * but I think it is not so ok to require folders to be acyclic, so we cannot automately reorder folders
  * but still, I think each package should have a z-index, and there should be a linter to suggest reorderings based on dependency
  * it is like my idea of language syntax based on rich text (nolex) instead of plain text, there are some similar design principle: the difference between editing stage and viewing stage, and doing more stuff at editing stage enables more possibilities
