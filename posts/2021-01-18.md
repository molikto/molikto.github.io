title: Notes on dependent type theory
---

* Q: Is [universe lifting a la McBride](https://mazzo.li/epilogue/index.html%3Fp=857&cpage=1.html) good enough?
  * one problem is small category, locally small category, and large category cannot be expressed properly
  * or can we get universe polymorphism AND cumulativity? Arend seems do this...
* Q: how does Arend do [packed/unpacked structures](https://arend-lang.github.io/about/arend-features#class-system)? it seems good.
* searching Lean archive, found [some](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/seminars) [discussion about difference between Arend and Lean](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Arend.20.E2.80.94.20HoTT.20ITP)
* reread the paper *Towards a practical programming language based on dependent type theory* for how to do more complex meta variables
* `Q`: it seems Lean's typeclass will bind a symbol to a single type class? [so it has have different theory for additive group and multiplicative groups](https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/a-review-of-the-lean-theorem-prover/)?
