title: Notes on dependent type theory

* Q: Is [universe lifting a la McBride](https://mazzo.li/epilogue/index.html%3Fp=857&cpage=1.html) good enough?
  * one problem is small category, locally small category, and large category cannot be expressed properly
  * or can we get universe polymorphism AND cumulativity? Arend seems do this...
* Q: how does Arend do [packed/unpacked structures](https://arend-lang.github.io/about/arend-features#class-system)? it seems good.
