- how do you implement typeclasses?
- first, let's see what [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1.3/language/instance-arguments.html#dependent-instances) and [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/typeclass.html) docs says
  - one thing really really bugs me is why Agda requires the type of the instance argument be of a certain shape `{Γ} → C(args)`, but Lean doesn't seems require this
  - another thing is how Agda's stdlib and Lean's stdlib differs in type signatures for function e.g. `List.filter` in Agda the property is implicit arg, and the decision procedure is explicit arg, in Lean the property is explicit arg, and the decision procedure is instance arg. I like how lean does it
  - **Canonical Structures** in Coq is packed records
- what's the problem with subtyping?
