someoone has done this https://pagedraw.io/tutorials/basics

there are a lot of Chinese devs copying what's been done in the west, and they are part successfull.

what blender has been achieved is wonderful. but why can it do this?

rendering graph etc. has no "papers" they are lead by software systems. is more open source tools a sustainable route?

is there a way to make it possible to two way edit JSX/JetpackCompose? just like the interface builders? a language-integerated way seems to be okish, but it will be really really hard
