<td align="left">* not only check types but also values, like a logic programming language!!! * yinwang0: <code>assert</code> and <code>assume</code> * <em>just dependent types</em> * change state by changing virtual table * <em>but if they are dynamically inferred, no dynamic dispatched is useful at all</em> * from advanced data structures :there are ops interchangeable, but a specific order is preferred for computing, because it is efficient. So can we achieve a language that can optimize your ops depending on your specification? Like SQL for objects? * no public etc., we treat it as different views by programmer * all things should be looks as if is pass by reference, but you CANNOT change reference!! * when chaining calls, we cannot perform inspection into it, i.e., the <code>onSomething</code>s * the software / hardware transition, the Yegge theory * pl that actually reformat code - to the surface efficiency * a less logical model in pl: assign reverse function to a function * I think the next study goal is static analysis, which follows directly after type system, and which can be found in APPL book * <a href="http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/polarity-in-type-theory/">http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/polarity-in-type-theory/</a> * create a pl what are write by all of the open source community and is done by trail and error * and by an object-oriented language, it is not necessary to make every part of data into heap, oo is just concept, we can decomposite the structure in compiled code!!! * we really need a feature vector like in natural language processing to spec so many details in pl design, for example, the scoping restrictions * a language where the machine has a wrapper, and from outside, it is pure, just all data is not mutable from outside!! * why there are runtime failures? because the user input is not statically checked!!! * subtype and params * val -&gt; val: well-defined contra and co * val, type -&gt; type: user defined * type -&gt; val: trivial, statically determined * structural typing and nominal typing: what is “structural”? it is…. just the… see above * the language is not based on logic, but BUILD OF THE TYPE TREE!!!!!!!! * I almost forget that C++ is by default non-virtual, so the DEFAULT design is THE MOST IMPORTANT!! * I still do not understand abstract class and trait. Please wait… and think * why interface??? because in the oo world, we are in an interface world, so the basic language only has interface!!!! and implement is shit! * I think most of the lazy etc, can be achieved by method decoration? * what is a self type? I think it is more of a inheritance thing, it is an modifiable inheritance template, but the method code is not changed * there is no problem with open recursion, but the library writer should aware that it can be override, and so on. He should be thinking like every function call is using the fist parameter but not calling the function now appear. * we should make the routing process viable to users, thus we can reuse any piece of code!!! * what is the parameterization mentioned n the paper??? * every method in an object is implicit an <code>[SelfType](this, params)</code> thing * all the things about programming is that output is not determined * a os that store all the sources, and you can partial compile using supercompiler * nothing is a pattern marching: just decomposition * a minimal language design can have only function type and pro * different level of abstraction, Nat is a type, and it is Orderable, Set<a href="#cross-T">T</a> is a type, if T is Orderable, then Set<a href="#cross-T">T</a> has an state called Ordered * to proof something about the real machine, you should have an model of the machine and then… shit like work * the Map<a href="#cross-T">T</a> if T is Orderable OrderableMap<a href="#cross-T">T</a> else etc. idea will not be working, because it is RUNTIME, and we cannot do this * something to refer when you want to create one! * <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?QuestForThePerfectLanguage/">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?QuestForThePerfectLanguage/</a> * <a href="http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/langopts.htm/">http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/langopts.htm/</a> * <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KeyLanguageFeature/">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KeyLanguageFeature/</a> * <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereAreExactlyThreeParadigms/">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereAreExactlyThreeParadigms/</a> * a compiler really do dynamic analysis of code usage and then modify the function table to predefined version * this is not cool maybe, it is complex and more: it do not change the complexity of the problem</td>

<h1 id="snailya-implementation-diary">Snailya implementation diary</h1>
<ul>
<li>day 1</li>
<li>in a type system sense, subtyping is never a problem</li>
<li>but OO is a real problem, <strong>but</strong>, I begin to see a unification of function and objects
<ul>
<li>in functional programming, you have closures</li>
<li>and for control flow etc, is just a function</li>
<li>I think I can resolve the problem this way, by making objects and functions identity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I think there are two flavor of OO
<ul>
<li>a closure thing, just a function, if used to produce a value, it is just an function</li>
<li>a model - but closure can be this!!</li>
<li>so everything is a object, we just need to make it easer to write</li>
<li>states</li>
</ul></li>
<li>subtyping, integer subtype real, bird subtype animal? the first one should use translational subtyping, the second one should use…</li>
<li>control flow thing as an typed function</li>
<li>the bad thing about OO is, you are believing it will cause side effect</li>
<li>the value of default value, the amount of information, so information is CRITICAL</li>
<li>object is partially applied function, so I understand it now</li>
<li>local heap, we require out data marked explicitly?</li>
<li>the state: there are happy John and sad John, but they are all John!! But a mathematical function is all about it’s VALUE, if the VALUE is changed, then they are not the same thing</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>

type Compiler = {
  param val from;
  val parser = Parser()
  val 
  def compile() = {

  }
}

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>So in summary I want</li>
<li>object
<ul>
<li>multi inheritance</li>
<li>state machine</li>
<li>state <code>val</code>s</li>
<li>subtyping</li>
<li>translational</li>
<li>no-translational</li>
<li>env, implicit arguments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>dependent typing
<ul>
<li>normalize as far as I can</li>
</ul></li>
<li>day 2</li>
<li>let’s build it first, the other things done latter</li>
<li><p>there is same conflict between value based function and real function!</p></li>
<li><p>the first draft</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="scaya">Scaya</h1>
<ul>
<li>idea of how Scaya works
<ul>
<li>method definition
<ul>
<li><code>def onCreate()</code> as normal</li>
<li><code>beta def onCreate()</code> in superclass, and includes one and only one <code>inner.onCreate()</code></li>
<li><code>insert def onCreate()</code> in class, inheritance from several classes
<ul>
<li>method invoked is is the most near class with <code>beta</code> definition</li>
<li>the whole subclass tree is linearized, no guarantee which one is of smaller order of same level</li>
<li>the inners is invoked in this linear way</li>
<li><code>super.onCreate()</code> is not allowed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>you can <code>override def onCreate()</code> a <code>beta</code> method then the method invocation back to normal</li>
<li>you can <code>override insert onCreate()</code>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>implementation
<ul>
<li>static dispatch considered easy</li>
<li><code>beta def name()</code> will be renamed to</li>
<li>every <code>insert def name()</code> is transformed into another method <code>insert def name#()</code></li>
<li>new method <code>def name()</code> is created which</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
